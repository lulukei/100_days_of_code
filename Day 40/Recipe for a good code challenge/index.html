    <h1>Recipe for a successful 100-day code challenge</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Great interest for a topic (that can survive outside of the work context)</li>
      <li>Humility towards your learning capacities</li>
      <li>A bunch a equally motivated companions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick a topic you have great interest in
      <li>Define the scope of your learning realistically (if you are a beginner, don't aim
    to reach the advanced level at the end of the 100 days)
      <li>Find a great resource you can learn from (a MOOC, an vido tutorial series, or a book - books
    are great way to get your face off the screen!)
      <li>Break it down into one hundred pieces (and evaluate if it is too much or too little for 100 days)
      <li>Commit to 1 piece a day (more than one is fine - but the key idea here is <em>endurance</em> so make sure you don't use up all
    your mental ressources for the next day)
      <li>Share daily with your learning companions for accountability
      <li>Bonus: the cliffhanger technique. Skim through the challenge of the next day to get excited and sleep on it
    </ol>
