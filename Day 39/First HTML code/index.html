  <title> Mathilde's 100 days of code </title>
  <body>
    <h1> 100 days of code </h1>
    <p> Presented on this website are visual projects
    based on the coding skills I aquired during the 100-day
    code challenge (November 29<sup>th</sup>-March 9<sup>th</sup>). During that time, I learned the basics
    of p5.js, HTML & CSS. </p>

    <h2> Why starting to code? </h2>
    <p> I think it is a mix of professional pragmatism and me wanting
    to express myself artistically. </p>

    <h2> Was it hard? </h2>
    <p> Yes and no. It is really true that you just need <em> 21 days </em>
    to make something a habit. After a 3 weeks, no doing my daily coding felt
    like not brushing my teeth.
    <br /> That being said, a lot of motivation comes from the group dynamics.
    The challenge started with my co-workers ot Mimi. After 10 days, we were
    2 people left out of 8. The last colleague "alive", Kevin, took a break
    arund Christmas time and I wasn't sure whether he vould come back.
    My motivation seriouslyflickered at that moment.
    <del>I harrassed him day and night so he would continue. </del>Luckily he resumed the
    challenge quickly. </p>

    <h2> A piece of advice to those who would like to start this challenge?</h2>
    <q>Genius is one percent inspiration and 99% perspiration</q> (Thomas Edison)
    <br /> So get to work! </p>
